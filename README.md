This project is based on the delivery of the information of a veterinary professional according to the query made using the identity document number. For this project, 
web scraping techniques were used to obtain the data and streamlit to display the data through an environment on a remote server.
For the execution of the project, clone the repository. The chromedriver file version is 103.0.5060.53. Remember that the version of the browser used is Google Chrome 
must be the same as the chromedriver. Install the requirements.txt file using the line ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Then run the following command line 
```streamlit run main.py```. In the terminal the address of the local host will appear as that of the remote host. Copy it to the browser and you will enter the Streamlit 
environment. Then you will find the box where you enter the document number.
